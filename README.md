## Impetus

Counting and Non-Parametric Statistics are essential when you either have categorical data for both predictors and response variables OR your data that you wanted to use a parametric approach (correlation, regression, ANOVA) is not well-behaved and will continue to conform to the assumptions of those models (e.g., normality, homoscedasticity, etc.).

## Student Learning Objectives

At the end of this topic, you should be able to:   

 - Identify specific non-parametric approaches that could be used based on the kind of data being presented.  
 - Perform appropriate non-parametric analyses given raw data, and. 
 - Communicate the results of non-parametric analyses.
